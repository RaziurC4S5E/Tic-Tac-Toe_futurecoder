# Tic-Tac-Toe_futurecoder
Trying to build a Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Python based on instructions from futurecoder.io

Each Tasks are decribed below:

1. Write a function row_winner which returns True if board contains a winning row, i.e. a horizontal line which has the same character in all its entries (except ' ')

2. write a similar function column_winner which checks for a winning column (a vertical line) of either piece


3. Now write a diagonal_winner that works for square boards of any size: 4-by-4, 5-by-5, and so on...

4. Now we can put the three functions together! Write a function winner that takes an argument board as before, and returns True if board contains either a winning row, column or diagonal, False otherwise.

Your solution should work by calling the three functions. winner itself should not do any looping, subscripting, etc.

5. Now write a diagonal_winner that works for square boards of any size: 4-by-4, 5-by-5, and so on...

6. Reconnect
